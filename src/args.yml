twitter image compression fixing tool

\nby default twitter compresses PNG images to save space.
\nthis can be circumvented by making 1 pixel slightly transparent,
\nin which case the server just stores it uncompressed. this tool
\nautomates this process making it easy to upload images without losing quality."
